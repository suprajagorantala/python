#You're writing code to control your town's traffic lights.
#You need a function to handle each change from green, to yellow, to red, and then to green again.

#Complete the function that takes a string as an argument representing the current state of the light and returns a string representing the state the light should change to.

#For example, when the input is green, output should be yellow.

#Test Case 1
#Input
#Green
#Output
#Yellow

#Test Case 2
#Input
#Red
#Output
#Green

''''light=input("enter current status of light:")
lst=['green','yellow','red']
for i in lst:
    if i=='red':
        print("The changed light is :",lst[0])
    elif light==i:
        t=lst.index(i)+1
        print("The changed light is :",lst[t])
        break

#output:enter current status of light:red
The changed light is : green'''
