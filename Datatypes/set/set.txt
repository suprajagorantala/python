1.  Add a list of elements to a given set
2. Return a set of identical items from a given two Python
3.Returns a new set with all items from both sets by removing duplicates
4.Given two Python sets, update first set with items that exist only in the first set and not in the second set.
5.Remove 10, 20, 30 elements from a following set at once
6.Return a set of all elements in either A or B, but not both
7.Determines whether or not the following two sets have any elements in common. If yes display the common elements
8. Update set1 by adding items from set2, except common items
9. Remove items from set1 that are not common to both set1 and set2
10.Write a Python program to check if a given set is superset of itself and superset of another given set
11.Write a Python program to check a given set has no elements in common with other given set
12.Write a Python program to remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set.
